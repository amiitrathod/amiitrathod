Who Am I?
Data Wizard 🧙‍♂️

I am a Machine learning and Data Science practitioner passionate about uncovering hidden facts and meaningful insights from messy data. Proficient in building effective Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models, running Data Pipelines, Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, building Recommendation Systems, and deploying solutions to the cloud.

I am an undergraduate in Computer Science Engineering from PRMCEAM, Badnera-Amravati, and currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer where I continue to learn and implement new things in Data Science across various projects.

I was introduced to the field of Data Science and Machine learning during my 3rd year in College, where I implemented projects in Natural Language Processing and ML. Since then, I breathe data.

What do I believe?
Personally, I believe in the thought that “In the grand tapestry of life, time is the thread that weaves our experiences together. It's not just a gift; it's the very fabric of our existence. Every moment we have is a unique opportunity to craft the masterpiece of our journey, and it's up to us to make each thread count”.

I am working towards a role where I can engage with a group of like-minded people who dream to bring a revolution in the world with data.
